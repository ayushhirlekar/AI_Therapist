### Part 2: Getting the Project

#### Step 2.1: Choose a Location for Your Project

1. **Create a projects folder**:
   - Open File Explorer
   - Go to your C: drive or Documents folder
   - Right-click → New → Folder
   - Name it `Projects`

2. **Open Command Prompt in that folder**:
   - Navigate to your Projects folder in File Explorer
   - Click in the address bar at the top
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter
   - Command Prompt opens in that folder

---

#### Step 2.2: Clone the Repository

In the Command Prompt window:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ayushhirlekar/AI_Therapist.git
```

**What this does**: Downloads all the project files from GitHub to your computer

**Wait for**: 
```
Cloning into 'AI_Therapist'...
...
done.
```

**Navigate into the project**:
```cmd
cd AI_Therapist
```

**Verify you're in the right place**:
```cmd
dir
```

You should see folders: `backend`, `frontend`, and files like `README.md`, `.gitignore`

---

### Part 3: Backend Setup

#### Step 3.1: Navigate to Backend Folder

```cmd
cd backend
```

**Verify**:
```cmd
dir
```

You should see: `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, folders like `app`, `database`, `services`

---

#### Step 3.2: Create Virtual Environment

**What is a virtual environment?**: An isolated Python installation for this project only. Keeps dependencies separate from your system Python.

**Create it**:
```cmd
python -m venv venv
```

**Wait for**: This takes 30-60 seconds. You'll see a new `venv` folder appear.

**Activate it**:
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Verify activation**: Your command prompt should now start with `(venv)`

Example:
```
(venv) C:\Projects\AI_Therapist\backend>
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: You MUST activate the virtual environment every time you work on the backend. If you close the terminal and reopen it, run `venv\Scripts\activate` again.

---

#### Step 3.3: Install Python Dependencies

**Upgrade pip first**:
```cmd
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

**Install all packages** (this takes 10-20 minutes):
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What's happening**: pip is downloading and installing 40+ Python packages from the internet

**You'll see lots of text scrolling**. This is normal. Wait for it to complete.

**Common messages you might see**:
- "Collecting [package name]" - downloading
- "Installing collected packages" - installing
- "Successfully installed" - done!

**Verify installation**:
```cmd
pip list
```

You should see a long list of packages including:
- Flask
- torch
- transformers
- llama-cpp-python
- flask-socketio
- And many more...

**If you see errors**:
- Make sure you activated the virtual environment (you should see `(venv)`)
- Make sure you have internet connection
- Try running the command again
- Some packages take multiple attempts

---

#### Step 3.4: Create Required Folders

**Create models folder**:
```cmd
mkdir models
```

**Create data folder**:
```cmd
mkdir data
```

**Verify**:
```cmd
dir
```

You should now see `models` and `data` folders.

---

#### Step 3.5: Download the AI Model (LARGEST STEP - 4GB Download)

**This is the brain of your AI assistant. It's a 4GB file.**

**Navigate into models folder**:
```cmd
cd models
```

**Download the model** (choose ONE method):

**Method 1 - Using curl (if available on your Windows)**:
```cmd
curl -L -o mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_0.gguf https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/resolve/main/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_0.gguf
```

**Method 2 - Manual Download (RECOMMENDED for Windows)**:

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/tree/main
3. Find the file: `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_0.gguf` (should be ~4GB)
4. Click on it
5. Click the download button (↓ icon)
6. Save it to your Downloads folder
7. Once downloaded, move the file to: `C:\Projects\AI_Therapist\backend\models\`

**This download will take 10-60 minutes depending on your internet speed.**

**Verify the file**:
```cmd
dir
```

You should see:
```
mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_0.gguf    (approximately 4GB)
```

**Return to backend folder**:
```cmd
cd ..
```

You should now be in: `C:\Projects\AI_Therapist\backend`

---

#### Step 3.6: Test Backend Setup

**Make sure virtual environment is still activated** (you should see `(venv)`)

**Run the Flask app**:
```cmd
python app.py
```

**What you should see**:
```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
 * Running on http://localhost:8000
```

⚠️ **If you see errors about missing model**: Double-check the model file is in the correct location and named exactly `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_0.gguf`

**LEAVE THIS WINDOW OPEN** - The backend is now running!

**To test it works**: Open a web browser and go to: http://localhost:8000/health

You should see: `{"status": "healthy"}`

**SUCCESS!** Your backend is working! 🎉

---

### Part 4: Frontend Setup

**Open a NEW Command Prompt window** (don't close the backend one)

#### Step 4.1: Navigate to Frontend Folder

```cmd
cd C:\Projects\AI_Therapist\frontend
```

**Verify you're in the right place**:
```cmd
dir
```

You should see: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `public` and `src` folders

---

#### Step 4.2: Install npm Dependencies

**Install all packages** (this takes 5-10 minutes):
```cmd
npm install
```

**What's happening**: npm is downloading hundreds of small JavaScript packages

**You'll see**:
- Progress bars
- Package names scrolling
- "added XXX packages"

**Common warnings you can ignore**:
- "deprecated" warnings
- "optional dependency" warnings
- "peer dependency" warnings

**Verify installation**:
```cmd
dir node_modules
```

You should see a folder with hundreds of subfolders (this is normal!)

---

#### Step 4.3: Start the Frontend

```cmd
npm start
```

**What happens**:
- Webpack compiles your React app
- Development server starts
- Your browser automatically opens to http://localhost:3000

**You should see**:
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.x.x:3000
```

**Your browser should automatically open** showing your AI Therapist interface!

**SUCCESS!** Your frontend is working! 🎉

---

## 🎮 Running the Application

### Every Time You Want to Use the App:

#### Terminal 1 - Backend:

```cmd
cd C:\Projects\AI_Therapist\backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python app.py
```

Leave this running.

#### Terminal 2 - Frontend:

```cmd
cd C:\Projects\AI_Therapist\frontend
npm start
```

Wait for browser to open.

### Stopping the Application:

- Press `Ctrl + C` in both terminal windows
- Close the browser tabs
- Type `deactivate` in the backend terminal to deactivate the virtual environment

---

## 🚫 Understanding What NOT to Push to GitHub

### Why Some Files Shouldn't Be on GitHub:

#### 1. **Large Files** (GitHub has a 2GB file limit per file, 100MB recommended max)

```
❌ backend/models/*.gguf          # AI model - 4GB
❌ *.db                            # Database files - contain user data
```

**Why**: Too large, would make repository huge and slow

**What to do**: Download separately (as you did in Step 3.5)

---

#### 2. **Dependencies** (Can be reinstalled)

```
❌ backend/venv/                   # Python virtual environment - 2-3GB
❌ frontend/node_modules/          # npm packages - 500MB+
```

**Why**: 
- Make repository massive
- Platform-specific (Windows vs Mac vs Linux)
- Can be recreated with `pip install` and `npm install`

**What to do**: Everyone creates their own using `requirements.txt` and `package.json`

---

#### 3. **Generated/Cache Files** (Auto-created)

```
❌ __pycache__/                    # Python cache
❌ *.pyc                           # Compiled Python
❌ .pytest_cache/                  # Test cache
❌ *.log                           # Log files
```

**Why**: Automatically regenerated, unnecessary clutter

---

#### 4. **Sensitive Information** (Security risk)

```
❌ .env                            # Environment variables (API keys, passwords)
❌ *.db                            # User data and conversations
```

**Why**: Privacy and security - never upload user data or secrets

---

### Your .gitignore File Protects You

The `.gitignore` file tells Git to ignore these files automatically. It's already configured in this project.

**To verify what Git is tracking**:
```cmd
git status
```

**You should NOT see**:
- Anything from `venv/`
- Anything from `node_modules/`
- `.gguf` files
- `.db` files

**You SHOULD see**:
- `.py` files (Python source code)
- `.js`, `.jsx` files (JavaScript source)
- `.json` files (configuration)
- `.md` files (documentation)
- `.css` files (styling)

---

## ✅ Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Backend Health Check

1. Make sure backend is running
2. Open browser: http://localhost:8000/health
3. Should see: `{"status": "healthy"}`

---

### Test 2: Chat API Test

**Open Command Prompt** (third terminal):

```cmd
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"message\": \"Hello, I need support\"}"
```

**Expected**: JSON response with AI-generated message

**If curl doesn't work on Windows**: Use Postman or test through the frontend

---

### Test 3: Frontend Connection

1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Type a message in the chat interface
3. Click Send
4. Should receive AI response within 5-10 seconds

---

## 🐛 Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: "python is not recognized"

**Symptoms**: When typing `python --version`, you get an error

**Solutions**:
1. Close Command Prompt and reopen
2. Restart computer
3. Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
4. Manually add Python to PATH:
   - Search "Environment Variables" in Windows
   - Edit "Path" variable
   - Add: `C:\Python311\` and `C:\Python311\Scripts\`

---

### Problem 2: "pip install" fails with errors

**Symptoms**: Red error text during `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Solutions**:

**If "Microsoft Visual C++ required"**:
1. Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
2. Install "Build Tools for Visual Studio"
3. Select "C++ build tools" workload
4. Install and restart
5. Try `pip install` again

**If "No module named..."**:
```cmd
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**If specific package fails**:
- Skip it temporarily
- Install others
- Try problem package alone: `pip install [package-name]`

---

### Problem 3: Virtual environment won't activate

**Symptoms**: `venv\Scripts\activate` doesn't work or does nothing

**Solutions**:

**Try**: PowerShell activation
```powershell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**If "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"**:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
Then try activating again.

**Alternative**: Use Command Prompt (cmd), not PowerShell

---

### Problem 4: Model file not found

**Symptoms**: Error when starting backend: "Model file not found"

**Solutions**:
1. Check file location: `dir backend\models\`
2. Verify filename exactly matches: `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_0.gguf`
3. Check file size: Should be ~4GB (3.8-4.2GB)
4. If corrupted, download again

**Check the path in code**:
- Open `backend/services/ai_service.py`
- Look for model path
- Make sure it matches your file location

---

### Problem 5: Port already in use

**Symptoms**: 
- Backend: "Address already in use" on port 8000
- Frontend: "Port 3000 is already in use"

**Solutions**:

**For port 8000**:
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
```
Find the PID (last column), then:
```cmd
taskkill /PID [number] /F
```

**For port 3000**:
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID [number] /F
```

**Or**: Frontend will ask "Would you like to run on another port?" - type `Y`

---

### Problem 6: "npm" command not found

**Symptoms**: When typing `npm --version`, you get an error

**Solutions**:
1. Close and reopen Command Prompt
2. Restart computer  
3. Reinstall Node.js
4. Check PATH includes: `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`

---

### Problem 7: Out of memory when loading model

**Symptoms**: Backend crashes or freezes when starting

**Solutions**:
1. Close unnecessary applications
2. Use smaller model (Q2 or Q3 quantization instead of Q4)
3. Increase virtual memory:
   - Right-click "This PC" → Properties
   - Advanced system settings
   - Performance → Settings
   - Advanced → Virtual memory → Change
   - Set custom size: 8192MB - 16384MB

---

### Problem 8: Git push fails - file too large

**Symptoms**: Error when pushing: "file too large" or "exceeds 100MB"

**Solutions**:

**Check what's being tracked**:
```cmd
git status
```

**If .gguf or large files appear**:
```cmd
git rm --cached backend/models/*.gguf
git rm --cached backend/data/*.db
```

**Update .gitignore**:
```cmd
echo *.gguf >> .gitignore
echo *.db >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Update gitignore"
```

---

### Problem 9: Frontend shows blank page

**Symptoms**: http://localhost:3000 opens but shows nothing

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify backend is running on port 8000
3. Check CORS settings in `backend/app.py`
4. Clear browser cache
5. Try incognito/private mode

---

### Problem 10: AI responses very slow

**Symptoms**: Takes 30+ seconds to get response

**Expected**: 5-10 seconds is normal for this model

**Solutions**:
1. Close other applications
2. Check CPU usage (Task Manager)
3. This is normal for local AI - it's processing on your CPU
4. Consider smaller model or cloud API for faster responses

    "react-dom": "^18.x",          // React DOM rendering
    "react-scripts": "5.x",        // Build tooling
    "web-vitals": "^2.x"           // Performance monitoring
  }
}
```
